ClubHack

Initial commits created at the Tufts Hackathon 2013.

Android app: a list of clubs, each with an associated description page.

Mostly a learning adventure in setting up the backend using Flask, a
Python microframework. Front is all Android (Java and xml). Based
heavily on previous projects, including:
  github.com/marsella/andrea
  github.com/chtran/tapitout

Some strong language may not be suitable for children.
